		Ugh! I hate planning vacations. I mean, I do love traveling but I don’t want to think about it. All those little details – I can’t be bothered!

		I prefer those all-inclusive kinds of vacations for a little R&R. You know, those places where all you do is show up and that’s it.

		You have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Activities, the beach, the pools, dancing. Sure, they usually cost a little more but if I don’t have to plan everything then it’s worth it. The only thing is you have to be careful of those hidden extras! I’ve definitely been surprised by the final bill a few times.

		My fiancé and I are talking about an all-inclusive cruise for our honeymoon. It sounds amazing but I’ve never been on a ship for that long.

		I’m a little nervous about seasickness I do love the idea of island-hopping. Plus the ship has a ton of amenities with its multiple pools, fitness centers, and restaurants. What I need to figure out is what to pack for a cruise. I’m actually terrible about over packing.

				The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

	<h2>“Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for.”</h2>
	<p>
		In The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach To Living A Good Life, former dating coach Mark Manson offers advice that’s both punchy and profane. The book is a good guide to figuring out what you want in life and at work, and how to achieve it. The route to this, Manson believes, lies in not caring too much about everything. Once you give up the need to feel exceptional and be positive and happy all the time, as well as your fear of failure, you will be better off. “The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, f*ck more, be more,” says Manson, who advocates that people focus instead on figuring out what’s important.

For those of us building careers, that would mean taking a hard look at what we want. If you don’t want 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, hoards of paperwork, and don’t want to navigate corporate hierarchies, explains Manson, that means you don’t really want to be CEO. If you don’t fancy taking risks, suffering repeated failures and working insane hours devoted to something that may earn absolutely nothing, you don’t want to be an entrepreneur. As Manson puts it, what determines your success is not what you want to enjoy, but how much suffering you’re willing to sustain to get there.</p>

		One kiss is all it takes
		Fallin' in love with me
		Possibilities
		I look like all you need
		Let me take the night, I love real easy
		And I know that you'll still wanna see me
		On the Sunday morning, music real loud
		Let me love you while the moon is still out
		Something in you, lit up heaven in me
